    "Risks": "We assess risks, opportunities and impacts as part of our global sustain- ability management within our company and along our value chain. As part of this process, we take into account the different subject-specific understandings of risks. In the case of \u2192 climate change, for example, we consider the potential impact of our business activities on the global greenhouse gas balance, as well as the potential impact of climate change on our business activities. In \u2192 human rights, on the other hand, we take into account the risks for the rights holders. This risk analysis is the basis for our human rights due diligence approach. At the same time, we closely track global and national developments on the understanding of terms, on the assessment of risks, opportunities, and impacts, and on the design of appropriate due diligence procedures. We will continue to develop our approaches together with the relevant processes to meet expectations in line with the strategic direction of our \u2192 2030+ Sustainability Ambition Framework. Uniform codes and standards worldwide Based on our corporate purpose, our vision, mission and \ud83d\udd17 v alues, we have formulated globally binding rules of conduct that are specified in a series of codes and corporate standards.

The \ud83d\udd17 Code o f Conduct contains the most important corporate principles and behavioral rules. It is supplemented by guidelines for dealing with potential conflicts of interest, which are designed to prevent corruption.",
